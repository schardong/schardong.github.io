I'm currently a post-doctoral fellow at [[https://www.isr.uc.pt/][Institute of Systems and Robotics, University of Coimbra]], where I work on projects with the [[https://visteam.isr.uc.pt/home][Visual Information Security Team (VISTEAM)]]. Up to January 2022, I was a research fellow at GALGOS/PUC-Rio, with experience on oil&gas industry from projects with PETROBRAS on well-testing and reservoir model inference. I'm also a part-time post-doc at [[https://www.visgraf.impa.br/home/][Visgraf/IMPA]], where I work on computer graphics and machine learning, with emphasis on implicit function reconstruction and rendering.

* Background
I got my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from UFSM in 2012 and a Master's degree in Informatics in the same university, in 2014, advised by prof. [[http://www.inf.ufsm.br/~pozzer][Cesar Pozzer]]. In 2018 I got my D.Sc. in Informatics at PUC-Rio, as a member of GALGOS. From 2014 to 2016 I worked as a developer under prof. [[http://www.inf.puc-rio.br/~celes][Waldemar Celes]] on the Reservoir Visualization group on Tecgraf/PUC-Rio Institute. In 2016 I started working with prof. [[https://www.inf.puc-rio.br/~lopes][Hélio Lopes]] (being advised by him since 2015) and was co-advised by prof. [[https://www.inf.puc-rio.br/~simone][Simone Barbosa]] during my doctorate. I'm currently a post-doctoral fellow at the Institute for Systems an Robotics, University of Coimbra at the [[https://visteam.isr.uc.pt/home][VISTEAM]] group, led by prof [[https://home.deec.uc.pt/~nunogon/][Nuno Gonçalves]]. I'm also a part-time post-doc collaborator, supervised by prof. [[https://www.impa.br/~lvelho][Luiz Velho]] from Visgraf/IMPA and prof. Hélio Lopes.

* Research
My current research interests involve mainly AI for Graphics and Implicit Function representation. Below is a selected list of projects and publications from the last 5 years.

** Exploring differential geometry in neural implicits [[[https://dsilvavinicius.github.io/differential_geometry_in_neural_implicits][Project page]]]
#+caption: Gaussian and Mean curvatures of the Stanford Armadillo. We calculated them from a smooth neural network trained on the Armadillo mesh. Afterwards, we used the analytical formulas of the curvatures on the neural network evaluated at the mesh vertices and plotted the results as colors.
