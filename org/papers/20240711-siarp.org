* Abstract
The main objective of the present invention is to enable continuous monitoring and detect anomalous behavior in wells equipped with intelligent completion automatically by means of a method implemented with artificial intelligence. The present invention applies AI techniques to monitor wells in an oil field and has the ability to understand what the usual behavior of each well would be, based on temperature, pressure and flow rate sensors, and then identify by means of a stochastic technique of selection of outliers which a deviation from usual behavior would be. From the outlier detection, it is possible to quantify an anomaly probability and associate the same with a possible event, such as: sensor failure and loss of data, closure of one of the producing intervals, scale deposition, among others.
