* Abstract
Neural fields have emerged as a promising framework for representing different types of signals. This tutorial focus on the existing literature and shares practical insights derived from hands-on experimentation with neural fields, specifically in approximating implicit functions of surfaces. Our emphasis lies in strategies leveraging differential geometry concepts to enhance training outcomes and showcase applications within this domain.
