* Introduction
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: intro
:END:
I'm currently a Research Scientist at [[https://www.isr.uc.pt/][Institute of Systems and Robotics, University of Coimbra]], where I work on projects with the [[https://visteam.isr.uc.pt/home][Visual Information Security Team (VISTEAM)]]. Up to January 2022, I was a research fellow at GALGOS/PUC-Rio, with experience on oil&gas industry from projects with PETROBRAS on well-testing and reservoir model inference. From 2020 to 2024 I was also a part-time post-doc at [[https://www.visgraf.impa.br/home/][Visgraf/IMPA]], where I worked on computer graphics and machine learning, with emphasis on implicit function reconstruction and rendering.

* Background

:CUSTOM_ID: backg
:END:
I got my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from UFSM in 2012 and a Master's degree in Informatics in the same university, in 2014, advised by prof. [[http://www.inf.ufsm.br/~pozzer][Cesar Pozzer]]. In 2018 I got my D.Sc. in Informatics at PUC-Rio, as a member of GALGOS. From 2014 to 2016 I worked as a developer under prof. [[http://www.inf.puc-rio.br/~celes][Waldemar Celes]] on the Reservoir Visualization group on Tecgraf/PUC-Rio Institute. In 2016 I started working with prof. [[https://www.inf.puc-rio.br/~lopes][Hélio Lopes]] (being advised by him since 2015) and was co-advised by prof. [[https://www.inf.puc-rio.br/~simone][Simone Barbosa]] during my doctorate. I'm currently a Research Scientist at the Institute for Systems an Robotics, University of Coimbra at the [[https://visteam.isr.uc.pt/home][VISTEAM]] group, led by prof [[https://home.deec.uc.pt/~nunogon/][Nuno Gonçalves]]. I'm also colaborate on a regular basis with prof. [[https://www.impa.br/~lvelho][Luiz Velho]] from Visgraf/IMPA.
